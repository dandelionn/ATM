# Virtual Automated Teller Machine

* A project which represents an automated teller machine(ATM) simulator, made in C++. The projects provides
support for adding and extracting banknotes from the cash machine, updating the client’s data, inquiring
balance on an account, and other options related to the management of an ATM. In the implementation of the
p roject I have used OOP concepts.For example, I have used polymorphism for describing different kind of
transactions which can be made with a cash machine.
* The project has a main class, ”Controller”, which contains instances of other classes and defines sev eral
member functions, which are responsible for combining methods belonging to other classes. For instance,
the link between the “View” class, which provides the drawing part of the program, and the “Model” class,
which provides the text afferent to each step of a transaction, is made with the help of the member functions
* This is one of my projects made during faculty because I wanted to learn how to make UIs and I had discovered win32.
